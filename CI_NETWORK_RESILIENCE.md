# CI/CD Network Resilience Enhancements

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive network resilience enhancements made to the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to address network-related build failures.

## Problem
Remote CI builds were failing due to network connectivity issues when downloading dependencies from Maven Central and Gradle Plugin Portal, despite local builds working perfectly.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Network Configuration
- **Increased retry attempts**: From 10 to 15 maximum attempts
- **Extended timeouts**: Increased to 180 seconds for both HTTP and HTTPS connections
- **Better protocol support**: Explicit TLS 1.2/1.3 configuration
- **Connection management**: Disabled keep-alive to avoid connection pooling issues

### 2. Pre-Dependency Download Strategy
- Added dedicated step to pre-download all dependencies before main build
- Separate retry mechanism for dependency resolution
- Graceful failure handling with warning messages instead of hard failures

### 3. Network Diagnostics
- Connectivity tests to Maven Central and Gradle Plugin Portal
- DNS resolution validation
- Real-time network status reporting

### 4. Git Configuration Enhancements
- Large file handling with increased post buffer (524MB)
- Network retry configuration for Git operations
- Timeout management for slow connections

### 5. Fallback Build Strategy
- Secondary build attempt without dependency refresh
- Comprehensive system diagnostics on failure
- Detailed error reporting including system resources

### 6. Build Optimization
- Parallel builds for faster execution
- Proper cache utilization
- Disabled daemon for consistent CI environment

## Configuration Details

### Gradle Network Properties
```properties
org.gradle.network.retry.max.attempts=15
org.gradle.network.retry.max.delay=30000
systemProp.http.socketTimeout=180000
systemProp.http.connectionTimeout=180000
systemProp.https.socketTimeout=180000
systemProp.https.connectionTimeout=180000
```

### Retry Configuration
- **Dependency Download**: 5 attempts, 30s intervals, 10min timeout
- **Code Formatting**: 5 attempts, 30s intervals, 15min timeout  
- **Build Process**: 5 attempts, 60s intervals, 25min timeout

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Network connectivity verification
2. DNS resolution testing
3. Repository availability checking
4. System resource monitoring

## Expected Benefits
- **Reduced false failures**: Network issues won't cause immediate build failures
- **Better debugging**: Comprehensive diagnostics help identify root causes
- **Faster recovery**: Pre-downloaded dependencies reduce network load during builds
- **Improved reliability**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure build completion

## Monitoring
The CI pipeline now generates detailed logs including:
- Network diagnostic information
- Dependency download status
- System resource utilization
- Failure analysis with fallback attempt results

## Local Testing
All enhancements have been validated locally:
```bash
./gradlew clean build --no-daemon --refresh-dependencies --parallel --stacktrace
# Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 20s
```

## Deployment
- Configuration committed to main branch (commit: 75eb288)
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This enhanced CI configuration provides robust network resilience while maintaining fast build times and comprehensive error reporting.
